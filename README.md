This is a simple mod I made to automagically sent splits to livesplit so I can speedrun Startup Company Game

The mod can be downloaded and install manually if you know what you're doing by downloading it from here, or found on steam here:

My splits are also in releases.

HOW TO USE

1. OPEN LIVESPLIT
2. LOAD IN STARTUP COMPANY SPLITS
3. START LIVESPLIT WEBSOCKET SERVER (right click > control > start websocket server)
4. LAUNCH STARTUP COMPANY WITH MOD INSTALLED (if startupcompany puts you in a game automatically, just exit and rightclick > control > reset livesplit. The timer will start automatically)
